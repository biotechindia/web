		The Mariana Trench is a V-shaped trench.The maximum depth where the scuba divers can swim is 40 meters deep and at the depth of 500m the world's largest mammals swims ie The Blue Whale this is the maximum depth where these whales can swim, further at 1000m this the maximum point here the sunlight reaches.

		<b>In the year 1960 Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh</b> were the first person who have reached till the end of the Mariana Trench.Scientists have even found life at this extreme deep point they are very weird,scary looking fishes.Till now the deepest swimming fish found at the depth ofn 8143m is the snailfish which is the deepest swimming fish of the world.During some scientific researches in the Mariana Trench they have found some extra ordinary large thing some says that it's the extinct prehistoric creature Megalodon.
		<br><br>

		 rattails,squids,crabs and dragonfishes.They have sharp thin teeths in a unalign order.As these sharks swim at a depth of 4000m so sunlight doesn't reaches over there because of which they are unable to see in dark so to hunt in dark they have super senses which sends them signal that the prey is near them because of which they are able to hunt in extreme dark too.</h3></p>
